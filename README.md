# Data-Driven Painting: Ultramarines Showcase

## Project Overview
This project, **Data-Driven Painting**, is a data-centric approach to painting Warhammer 40k miniatures, specifically focusing on the iconic **Ultramarines**. Known for their disciplined adherence to the Codex Astartes, Ultramarines are characterized by their striking blue armor, golden accents, and Roman-inspired motifs, embodying ideals of discipline and valor.

---

## Objective
The goal of this project is to build a data-driven app that recommends optimal painting techniques, color schemes, and patterns for Ultramarines miniatures, blending lore-inspired schemes with personal creativity.

---

## Techniques and Themes
### **Color Scheme**
- **Primary**: Deep Blue
- **Accents**: Gold
- **Details**: White, Red (chapter symbols, banners)

### **'Eavy Metal Style**
- **Highlights**: Sharp, high contrast with edge highlighting
- **Shading**: Clean color transitions, controlled shading for depth

### **Lore Integration**
Ultramarines follow the Codex Astartes, guiding them to:
- **Display Roman-inspired laurels**
- **Use symbols and patterns** on armor that honor their chapterâ€™s history

---

## Data Components
The app will use a curated database of:
- **Color Combinations** for armor, weapons, and embellishments
- **Highlighting Techniques** based on armor position
- **Recommended Brushes and Paints** for precision
- **Lore-based Patterns** for customization

---

## Project Structure
Organized for ongoing data expansion, allowing users to explore and apply various painting styles.

---

## Future Scope
Additional chapters and painting techniques may be added to provide customizable painting guidance across other Warhammer 40k factions.
